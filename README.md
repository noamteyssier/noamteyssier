# Hello! 

I'm Noam Teyssier, a Bioinformatics PhD Candidate in the [Kampmann Lab](https://kampmannlab.ucsf.edu/) and [Goodarzi Lab](https://goodarzilab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF.

I work at the intersection of functional genomics, machine learning, dynamical modeling, and systems biology in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

I highly value open source and try to share all the [tools I've developed](https://noamteyssier.github.io/tools/) during my own research.
